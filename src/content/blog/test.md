looking for new ways to improve my workflow. I'm also a big fan of the Unix philosophy, and I try to follow it as much as
possible.


## Hardware stuff

As a student, I can't afford to buy a lot of hardware, or not necessarily what
I want. However, I am quite proud of the results I achieve despite the constraints of my limited budget.

I aim to both indulge my passion for gaming and refine my programming skills !
I spend about 35% of my time on competitive multiplayer video games like

I love this laptop; it's a great machine, but I'm not a fan of the keyboard. I had to replace it due to the well-known

I'm considering buying a new laptop with an M1/2 chip, but I don't have the budget for it right now.
