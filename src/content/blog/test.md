Small optimizations to your workflow can have a significant impact on your productivity, This is why I spend a lot of time
customizing my environment to make it as efficient as possible. I use a lot of tools to help me with this, and I'm always
looking for new ways to improve my workflow. I'm also a big fan of the Unix philosophy, and I try to follow it as much as
possible.


## Hardware & Peripherals

As a student, my budget is a significant constraint, leading me to make decisions based on necessity rather than desire. Despite these financial limitations, I take great pride in achieving satisfactory results.

That said, the wait has been long before finally being able to afford a quality setup, but the results are worth it.

My goal is to balance my passion for video games with the improvement of my programming skills. I dedicate **~35%** of my time to **competitive online video games** like League of Legends and Valorant, video games that require a lot of concentration and focus, while the remaining **~65%** is allocated to **programming**.

    The reality is that the majority of my life unfolds "at my desk"
</span>, which has prompted me to prioritize this space by investing in my setup.

My process of setting up my work environment began in 2018, after my move, with the purchase of a desk, a [brown Malm from Ikea]( https://www.ikea.com/fr/fr/p/malm-bureau-brun-noir-00214157/ ), but I would like to upgrade to something larger in the future, although that won't be possible for now due to space constraints üòî

I adore the allure of dark wood, and I'd like something along those lines, preferably with a motorized system to adjust the height, allowing me to work standing at times.

This desk remained empty for a long time ü•≤, but after a while, I was finally able to purchase one MacBook Pro 13" ( 2018 )

I love this laptop; it's a great machine, but I'm not a fan of the keyboard. I had to replace it due to the well-known
issues with the butterfly mechanism. Over time, and after many hours of use, the battery life has also significantly decreased.

I'm considering buying a new laptop with an M1/2 chip, but I don't have the budget for it right now.
