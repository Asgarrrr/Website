## Hardware stuff

As a student, I can't afford to buy a lot of hardware, or not necessarily what
I want. However, I am quite proud of the results I achieve despite the constraints of my limited budget.

I aim to both indulge my passion for gaming and refine my programming skills !
I spend about 35% of my time on competitive multiplayer video games like
League of Legends, and 65% of my time is dedicated to other activities and responsibilities.

issues with the butterfly mechanism. Over time, and after many hours of use, the battery life has also significantly decreased. 

I'm considering buying a new laptop with an M1/2 chip, but I don't have the budget for it right now.
