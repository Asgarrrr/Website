Defending user data and preserving confidentiality is of utmost significance in the dynamic world of web development.
A robust authentication and authorization framework serves as the shield against potential vulnerabilities, ensuring
the protection of user accounts and enabling precise control over application access.

In this comprehensive guide, we explore the intricate process of crafting an impregnable authentication and authorization
system by harnessing the power of Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. Immerse yourself in the depths of this article as we
uncover the essential steps and components required to fortify your web application's security posture.

_But first, let's briefly understand some basic ideas before we go into the specifics of how it will be put into action._

## Grasping the Concept of Authentication and Authorization

Before diving into implementation, I think it's necessary to highlight the difference between these two concepts.
Authentication and authorization are fundamental concepts in the realm of security and access control within web applications.

**Authentication** refers to the process of **verifying the identity of a user**, ensuring they are who they claim to be.
It involves the collection and validation of credentials, such as usernames and passwords, to grant access to specific resources
or functionalities.

On the other hand, **authorization** deals with **determining what actions or resources a user is allowed to access** based
on their authenticated identity and assigned permissions.
It involves defining and enforcing access control policies to protect sensitive data and maintain the integrity of the system.

Together, authentication and authorization form a vital duo, safeguarding user accounts and providing the necessary controls
to manage access effectively in web applications.

## J W ... T ?

A JSON Web Token ( JWT ) is a concise and secure way to exchange information between two parties.

The information, known as claims, is encoded as a JSON object. It can be used as the payload of a JSON Web Signature (JWS)
structure for digital signing or as the plaintext of a JSON Web Encryption (JWE) structure for encryption.
This allows the claims to be protected against tampering with a Message Authentication Code (MAC) and/or encrypted for
confidentiality.

To summarize simply:

- A JWT is a token used for sharing security information between parties.
- It is commonly used for authentication and authorization in web applications and APIs.
- A JWT consists of three parts: the header, the claims, and the signature.
- The header contains metadata about the token, such as the encryption algorithm used.
- The claims are specific pieces of information about the user or additional data.
- The signature is used to verify the integrity of the token and authenticate the issuer.

To learn more about JWT, you can consult the following resources:

- [JWT.io]( https://jwt.io/introduction ): A website that provides a comprehensive introduction to JWT, as well as a debugging tool to decode, verify, and generate JWT.
- [RFC 7519]( https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7519 ): The official specification for JWT.
- [Auth0 - JSON Web Tokens]( https://auth0.com/learn/json-web-tokens ): A detailed guide on JWT with usage examples.
- [Google Cloud - Authenticating Users with JWT]( https://cloud.google.com/api-gateway/docs/authenticating-users-jwt ): A guide on user authentication with JWT in Google Cloud.

## Preparing the Development Environment
Before we embark on building our authentication system, let's ensure our development environment is properly set up.
For this project, we'll be using [`bcrypt`]( https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt ), [`jsonwebtoken`]( https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonwebtoken ), [`dotenv`]( https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv ), [`mongoose`]( https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose ) and [`express`]( https://www.npmjs.com/package/express ).

```bash
mkdir project-name
cd project-name
npm init -y
npm install express mongoose bcrypt jsonwebtoken dotenv
```

During development, we'll be using a local MongoDB database. To set up a local MongoDB instance, you can follow the
instructions in the [official documentation]( https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/ ). Alternatively, you can
use a cloud-based MongoDB service such as [MongoDB Atlas]( https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas ).

After installing the required packages, create a new file named `.env` in the project directory. This file will contain
sensitive information such as the database connection string and JWT secret key. Add the following code to the file:

```bash
PORT=3000                                           # Port number for the server
MONOGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/auth           # MongoDB connection string
JWT_SECRET=secret                                   # JWT secret key
```

Next, we'll create the project structure. Create the following directories and files in the project directory ( Don't
worry, we'll go through each file in detail later on, so you don't have to understand everything right now ) :

```bash
project-name
â”œâ”€â”€ .env
â”œâ”€â”€ app.js
â”œâ”€â”€ controllers
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ auth.js
â”œâ”€â”€ models
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ user.js
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â”œâ”€â”€ package-lock.json
â”œâ”€â”€ node_modules
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ A TON OF STUFF
â”œâ”€â”€ routes
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ auth.js
â””â”€â”€ utils
    â””â”€â”€ auth.js
```

Perfect! We're all set to begin building our authentication system.

## Creating the User Model

I think it's best to start by creating the user model. The user model will define the structure of the user document
stored in the database. It will also contain the logic for generating and verifying JWTs.

Create a new file named `user.js` in the `models` directory and add the following code:

```javascript

const mongoose  = require( "mongoose" )
    , bcrypt    = require( "bcrypt" )
    , jwt       = require( "jsonwebtoken" )

const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({

    username: {
        type: String,
        required: true,
        unique: true,
        trim: true,
        lowercase: true
    },
    password: {
        type: String,
        required: true,
        trim: true
    },
    role: {
        type: String,
        enum: [ "user", "admin" ],
        default: "user"
    }

});

// â€”â€” Hash the password before saving the user model
userSchema.pre( "save", async function( next ) {

    const user = this;

    if ( user.isModified( "password" ) )
        user.password = await bcrypt.hash( user.password, 10 );

    next();

});


// â€”â€” Generate an auth token for the user
userSchema.methods.generateAuthToken = async function() {

    const user = this;
    const token = jwt.sign( { _id: user._id }, process.env.JWT_SECRET, { expiresIn: "1h" } );
    return token;

};

```

The user model is defined using the `mongoose.Schema` class. The schema defines the structure of the user document,
including the data types of each field and the validation rules.

Next, we define a pre-save hook to hash the password before saving the user model. The `isModified()` method is used to
check if the password field has been modified. If it has, the password is hashed using the `bcrypt.hash()` method and
the hashed password is saved to the database.

Finally, we define a method to generate a JWT for the user. The `jwt.sign()` method is used to generate a JWT with the
user's ID as the payload. The JWT is signed using the JWT secret key defined in the `.env` file. The `expiresIn` option
is used to set the expiration time of the JWT to 1 hour. The `generateAuthToken()` method returns the generated JWT.

## Creating the Authentication Controller

Next, we'll create the authentication controller. The authentication controller will contain the logic for registering
