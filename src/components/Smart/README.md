# Smart X Directory

This directory contains my smart components. I use them all over the website to get things done easily.

- The `Link` component detects if the given `href` is an internal page or not and uses Vue Router if it is. Also has some helper props.
- The `Image` component uses Nuxt Image to optimize images for production and returns a image wrapped up in a `div` with a `background-image` CSS property.
