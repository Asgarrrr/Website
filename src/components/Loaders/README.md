# Loaders Directory

This directory holds different static loaders to be used in the website. They are just placeholders that are visible when a content is being loaded. Take [Songs](https://eggsy.xyz/me/songs) page for example, the `Loaders/Songs.vue` is used until the data is fetched and page is generated.
